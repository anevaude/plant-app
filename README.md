# Plant App (Firebase)

## Summary
The app provides gardeners with an easy way of taking inventory of their plants. 

Plant care requires keeping keeping track of many details - including growing zones, light needs, soil chemistry, bloom times, pollination, size, and so on. The focus of this app was to allow the user to keep track of all those details, in a clear, easy-to-understand and visually pleasing way.

I created this app because I needed a way to keep track of my growing collection of indoor and outdoor plants. When I started this app, I had at least 30 new plants to learn about.
