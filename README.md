# Plant App (Firebase)

The app provides gardeners with tool to keep inventory of their plants. 

Plant care requires keeping keeping track of a LOT of details (growing zones, light needs, soil chemistry, bloom season, mature size, and so on.) I wanted to make an app that can keep track of all those details while still being easy-to-use and visually pleasing.

I created this app because I needed a way to keep track of my growing collection of indoor and outdoor plants. When I started this app, I had at least 30 new plants to learn about.

## Technologies
